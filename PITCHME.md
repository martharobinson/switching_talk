## Lights on, lights off
#### "switching" cells in the reina
---

@title[Introduction to the retina]
- graded potentials
- rod signals "parasitic" on cone pathway via gap junction
- 1st synapse "backwards"
- needs to operate over a large range of environmental light levels

Separation into ON and OFF channels by receptor expression + anatomy

@title[Methods]

- Setup
- Example STAs

@title[Some cells switch polarity]

- Example cells
- Summary plot -> switching is common
