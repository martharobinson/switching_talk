Note:
Just keep on to 3 key ideas:
The retina needs to operate and signal meaningfully over a large range of environmental light levels
The retina has two main classes of input cells: rod and cone photoreceptors, that are specialised to dim light and bright light
Rod pathway is "parasitic" on cone pathway via AII cells.
Classically, retina is thought to be separated into ON and OFF channels, is by receptor expression and by anatomy
