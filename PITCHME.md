@title[Introduction to the retina]

Note:
Just keep on to 3 key ideas:
The retina needs to operate and signal meaningfully over a large range of environmental light levels
The retina has two main classes of input cells: rod and cone photoreceptors, that are specialised to dim light and bright light
Rod pathway is "parasitic" on cone pathway via AII cells.
Classically, retina is thought to be separated into ON and OFF channels, is by receptor expression and by anatomy

@title[Summary]
##### Summary
- Switching was common (28%)
- Swiching occured between every pair of light levels
- One cell can switch multiple times
- Switching is assocaited with spatial instability

Note:
What mechanism could explain this? 
Why do cells switch polarity?
